# Adding media to articles

With the focus of online first journalism, Pipeline has new features that can added within articles. As of now, there are two widgets to choose from.

## Spotify widget

The spotify widget can be embedded in two ways with either a singular song or a whole album.

A singular song can be placed as a block within an article. To do so, you will need to edit the article and add an "embed" block. 

In the block, copy over a song link from Spotify. This can be done by searching for a song in Spotify, and clicking on the "..." link that shows up while hovering on a song name. Click on "Copy Song Link."

Paste this song url into the article admin page under the new block you added.

### Entire album

An album can be added to an article. Add an "embed" block to the article. In the same way as mentioned before, copy over the album link from Spotify. Paste this into the block text.

## YouTube widget

A YouTube widget can be added within articles to support any videos. To add a video, add an "embed" block within the article.

Copy over the video URL from YouTube. The link can be found by clicking on "Share" for a video. Paste it into the new block.

## Other sources

Pipeline supports other sources of media as long as they support the oEmbed format. Many popular content providers do.

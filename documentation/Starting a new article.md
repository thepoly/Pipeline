# Starting a New Article

 
## Requirements

> Hopefully, you can log into Wagtail admin. If you can't, that's the first step.

## Getting started

> Look at the sidebar and click on "Pages." Then, click on "The Polytechnic."


## Picking a section; new articles are child pages of their sections

> This should open a list of current sections (ex: Features, Ed-Op, Staff). Hover over the section you want and click on "ADD CHILD PAGE."


## Fill out new article information and add appropriate fields

> Here, a new article page should open up. Enter the headline, subdeck, and select the appropriate kicker.


### Authors

> Authors are handled differently in Pipeline. Each author has their own page, and therefore, you must select the author instead of simply typing in their name. This allows us to store all the articles an author has written together.

> When adding an author, they must first be added as a contributor. The Wagtail interface will prompt you to add a new contributor if your desired author can't be found.


### Photos

> Select photo(s) associated with the article. For a more detail breakdown of photos within Pipeline, look at the "Understanding photos" documentation.

### Summary

> Fill out a summary to go with the article. Summaries will show up under the article headline in the section pages as well as in the homepage.


### Article body

> The article body will be built with multiple options, including images, paragraphs, and select media types. Pick which option you are looking for, and copy in the text. By separating paragraphs, it allows for extra customization of the article page. 

> For a more detail breakdown of media within Pipeline, look at the "Adding media to articles" documentation.


## Filling out "Promote" information

> Click on the "Promote" tab. The most important field to fill out is "Slug." This is the name or link that will be used to access this article once it goes live.

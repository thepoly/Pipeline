# Understanding Photos

> Photos are saved as snippets. This is similar to the media library in Wordpress. 

> To upload a photo, you must add it as a snippet. The Snippets tab for all saved snippets is on the navigation bar on the left.

> Click on "ADD PHOTO" on the top right. Save a png/jpg file as a photo and add a caption.

> Now, the image is saved as a snippet and can be inserted into any article or location.

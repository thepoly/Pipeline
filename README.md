# Pipeline

Pipeline is [_The Rensselaer Polytechnic_](https://poly.rpi.edu)'s next
website. It will enable rapid development of new article layouts and
interactive features. In the long term, it will provide a solid platform for
our content over the coming decade and support _The Poly_'s focus on
online-first journalism.

## Requirements

Ensure these are installed before continuing.

- [Python 3.7](https://www.python.org) or Python 3.6
- [Pipenv](https://docs.pipenv.org)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)
- [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org)

You can change Pipeline's settings to use SQLite instead of Postgres, but this is not recommended because Pipeline relies on Postgres's full-text search features.

## Getting started

Pipeline is written in Python. It uses Sass and PostCSS on the frontend with webpack to glue them together.

#### Note about Postgres

Pipeline expects to be able to connect to a Postgres database named `pipeline`. To set this up on macOS:

```
brew install postgresql
brew services start postgresql
createdb pipeline
```

### Installing

```
git clone git@github.com:thepoly/pipeline.git
cd pipeline
npm install
npx wp --config webpack.development.config.js
pipenv install --dev
pipenv run python manage.py createcachetable
```

### Running

```
pipenv shell
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py createsuperuser
python manage.py runserver
```

If you have issues with the database, ensure that Postgres is running and you have created a database named `pipeline`.

#### Docker

Pipeline can also be run in its production configuration with Docker. It requires three containers: one for running the Django project with gunicorn, another to put nginx in front of it and additionally serve static files, and finally a Postgres container.

```docker-compose up```

Ensure that the `SECRET_KEY` environment variable is set. Additionally, run the following inside of the `django` container (e.g. `docker-compose exec django bash`):

```
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

Pipeline will be available at port 8000 on localhost.

### Standards

Make sure you format your code with [Black](https://github.com/python/black) and use [Flake8](http://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/) to find problems.

### How to make changes to styling

With your terminal/command prompt running ```python manage.py runserver```, open another at the project folder location and run ```npm run watch```.
Now you can edit styles at pipeline/pipeline/static/css/pipeline.scss

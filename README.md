# Pipeline

Pipeline is [_The Rensselaer Polytechnic_](https://poly.rpi.edu)'s next
website. It will enable rapid development of new article layouts and
interactive features. In the long term, it will provide a solid platform for
our content over the coming decade and support _The Poly_'s focus on
online-first journalism.

## Requirements

Ensure these are installed before continuing.

- [Python 3.7](https://www.python.org) or Python 3.6
- [Pipenv](https://docs.pipenv.org)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)
- [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org)

You can change Pipeline's settings to use SQLite instead of Postgres, but this is not recommended because Pipeline relies on Postgres's full-text search features.

## Getting started

Pipeline is written in Python. It uses Sass and PostCSS on the frontend with webpack to glue them together.

#### Note about Postgres

Pipeline expects to be able to connect to a Postgres database named `pipeline`. To set this up on macOS:

```
brew install postgresql
brew services start postgresql
createdb pipeline
```

The default dev database, defined in `settings/dev.py` uses the following postgres url: `postgresql://postgres:postgres@127.0.0.1:5432/pipeline` make sure that your database is configured to these settings. The pipeline database must exist, and the user `postgres` must exist with password `postgres`. Read more about postgres urls [here](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/libpq-connect.html#LIBPQ-CONNSTRING).

Read about creating a user [here](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/role-attributes.html). You will probably want postgres to be a superuser.

### Installing with pipenv

```
git clone https://github.com/thepoly/pipeline.git
cd pipeline
npm install
npx webpack --config webpack.development.config.js
pipenv install --dev
pipenv run python manage.py createcachetable
```

If you have issues with `pipenv`, you should use `virtualenv`. Installation varies by dev environment.

#### Running with pipenv

```
pipenv shell
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py createsuperuser
python manage.py runserver
```

If you have issues with the database, ensure that Postgres is running and you have created a database named `pipeline`.

### Installing with virtualenv

```bash
git clone https://github.com/thepoly/pipeline.git
cd pipeline
npm install
npx webpack --config webpack.development.config.js
virtualenv pipeline-env # Enter the virtual environment
source pipeline-env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python manage.py createcachetable
```

#### Running with virtualenv 

```sh
source pipeline-env/bin/activate # If not in the enviroment
python manage.py migrate # run migrations
python manage.py createsuperuser
python manage.py runserver
```

#### Docker

Pipeline can also be run in its production configuration with Docker. It requires three containers: one for running the Django project with gunicorn, another to put nginx in front of it and additionally serve static files, and finally a Postgres container.

```docker-compose up```

Ensure that the `SECRET_KEY` environment variable is set. Additionally, run the following inside of the `django` container (e.g. `docker-compose exec django bash`):

```
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

Pipeline will be available at port 8000 on localhost.

### Standards

Make sure you format your code with [Black](https://github.com/python/black) and use [Flake8](http://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/) to find problems.

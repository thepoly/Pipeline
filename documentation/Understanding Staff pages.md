# Understanding Staff pages

> Each staff member gets their own page in Pipeline. This makes it very easy to keep track of articles an individual writes as well as makes adding an author to an article very simple.

## Adding new staff members

> In the Wagtail admin, there is a Staff index page that contains all child pages for individual staff members. Once in this index page, to add a new staff member, click on "ADD CHILD PAGE." Add all information for this member and save.

> A staff member must also be added as a contributor. This will be prompted to you as you try to add an author to an article.

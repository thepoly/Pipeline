# Pipeline

> Welcome to the new website for _The Polytechnic_!

> This folder should serve as your guide to navigating Wagtail. If you have any questions or something doesn't make sense, please ask.

## Getting started

> The first step is to log into Pipeline. The credentials needed will match those of your poly email.

> Once logged in, spend some time looking through the Wagtail interface. There are a lot of new changes from the previous website that will need time to understand.

> Read the "Wagtail's Tree Structure" documentation to see how Wagtail stores articles and sections.

# Adding media to articles

> With the focus of online first journalism, Pipeline has new features that can added within articles. As of now, there are two widgets to choose from.

## Spotify widget

> The spotify widget can be embedded in two ways with either a singular song or a whole album.

### One Song Version

> A singular song can be placed as a block within an article. To do so, you will need to edit the article and add a "spotify_one_song" block. 

> In the block, copy over a song link from Spotify. This can be done by searching for a song in Spotify, and clicking on the "..." link that shows up while hovering on a song name. Click on "Copy Song Link."

> Paste this song url into the article admin page under the new block you added. Additionally, change the url to include the word "embed" after Spotify's base url. 

> For example: https://open.spotify.com/track/2VxeLyX666F8uXCJ0dZF8B should be changed to https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/2VxeLyX666F8uXCJ0dZF8B.

### Entire Album Version

> An album can be added to an article. Add a "spotify_widget" block to the article. In the same way as mentioned before, copy over the album link from Spotify. Paste this into the block text. Again, add "embed" within the url.

## Youtube widget

> A Youtube widget can be added within articles to support any videos. To add a video, add a "youtube_widget" block within the article.

> Copy over the video url from Youtube. The link can be found by clicking on "Share" for a video and copying the "Embed" button.

> The only text that matters from the "Embed" code is the url in the "src" tag. Copy the link and paste it into the new block.
